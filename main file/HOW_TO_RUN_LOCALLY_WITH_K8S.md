# üè† Running Kubernetes Locally

## Question: Can I see output on localhost with K8s?

**YES!** But you need a local K8s cluster first.

---

## Option 1: Keep Running Local (Easiest)

**Right now you're running:**
```bash
npm run dev  # Runs on localhost:3000
```

**This works fine and shows output in browser!**
- ‚úÖ Runs locally
- ‚úÖ Shows on localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ No K8s needed
- ‚úÖ Fastest for development

---

## Option 2: Run K8s Locally (For Learning)

If you want to test Kubernetes deployment:

### Step 1: Install minikube (Local K8s cluster)

**On Mac:**
```bash
brew install minikube
minikube start
```

**On Linux:**
```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
minikube start
```

### Step 2: Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t activity-tracker:latest .

# Load into minikube
minikube image load activity-tracker:latest

# Deploy
bash k8s-deploy.sh
```

### Step 3: Access on localhost

```bash
# Port forward to localhost
kubectl port-forward -n activity-tracker service/activity-tracker-service 8080:80

# Now open browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

**‚úÖ You'll see your app on localhost:8080!**

## Quick Comparison

| Method | Command | Access URL | Use Case |
|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Local Dev** | `npm run dev` | http://localhost:3000 | ‚úÖ Development, fastest |
| **K8s Port-Forward** | `kubectl port-forward ...` | http://localhost:8080 | ‚úÖ K8s testing, learning |
| **K8s LoadBalancer** | External IP | http://EXTERNAL-IP | ‚úÖ Production |

---

## My Recommendation

**For now:** Just use `npm run dev`
- ‚úÖ Simpler
- ‚úÖ Faster
- ‚úÖ Easier to debug
- ‚úÖ Shows on localhost:3000

**Later:** Learn K8s by:
1. Installing minikube
2. Running locally with K8s
3. Then deploying to cloud (GKE/EKS/AKS)

---

## TL;DR

**Current setup (npm run dev):**
- ‚úÖ Works on localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ No K8s needed
- ‚úÖ Perfect for development

**With K8s:**
- Need to install minikube (or use cloud cluster)
- Then can access via port-forward on localhost
- More complex but good for learning

**Bottom line:** You're already seeing output on localhost! K8s files are ready when you want to deploy to a cluster. üöÄ
